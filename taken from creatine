[one_half]</p><h2>HOW DOES CREATINE MONOHYDRATE WORK</h2><p>Creatine Monohydrate (CM) is one of the most extensively researched and validated molecules, and is accepted as one of the most popular and effective ergogenic substances used in sports.</p><h4 style="border-top: 1px solid #ededed; padding-top: 3% !important;">Power Output – Recharging Your Cell Batteries (ADP -&gt; ATP)</h4><p>From its neuroprotective to cardioprotective properties, creatine supplementation has been shown to improve power output. For an athlete, this translates to increasing their capacity for high-intensity exercise, as well as lean body mass.<sup><a href="http://www.aptsupps.com/how-does-creatine-monohydrate-work/#1">1</a></sup></p><p>When performing a bicep curl, ATP releases one of its phosphate groups, converting ATP to ADP. If you push hard enough, the set ultimately ends when the body’s ATP stores are depleted. In between sets, Creatine donates its phosphate (CP) to ADP to form new ATP to power through the next set.* For example, users of creatine typically report the ability to use more weight, for more repetitions and more sets.*</p><p style="text-align: left;"><a class="button" href="http://aptsupps.com/how-does-creatine-monohydrate-work/" target="_blank">Read More</a>[/one_half]
